# SQL Alchemy Challenge

Hello!
Welcome to my challenge, where I dive into getting the past few years worth of weather date in Hawaii, to help you plan for your upcoming trip!

Upon opening the HTML page, please replace the <start> / <end> date with any date you wish between the years of 2016 through 2017-08-23. The format needed is (YR, M, D)
  
I unfortuntely could not figure out how to load the "temp, min, avg, temp" on the columns to help read what you are reading on the API page, but I will continue working on improving this.
  

 Any help or suggestions upon grading are welcome.
  Thank you for your time and have a fantastic day.
